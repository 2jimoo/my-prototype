{"doc_id": 1, "author": "Taylor", "text": "I assume that you mean that $Z$ given $Y$ is conditionally independent of everything. So your equality follows from definitions. Have a look at this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence. There are two ways to look at conditional independence. One: $$ p(z,x|y) = p(z|y)p(x|y), $$ or two: $$ p(z|y,x) = p(z|y). $$"}
{"doc_id": 2, "author": "Florian Hartig", "text": "Note that, even though you use the glm function, you are fitting a standard linear model (lm) here It looks as if you are not fitting the right functional form. First, plot res vs. predictors, and then try adding other polynomial terms (e.g. I(pH^2), or sqrt(pH)) or interactions, e.g. pH*temperature, depending on what you see."}
{"doc_id": 3, "author": "user2974951", "text": "Given your diagnostic plots it is not looking good for a regular OLS linear model. The residual plot is displaying a clear negative trend, the QQ plot is clearly not normal and in general the scale-location plot shows signs of what you would expect with a categorical variable having a strong influence on your results. You've mentioned that a lot of times your DV topic size has very similar values and these are all integers, so maybe some sort of poisson regression may work better. Alternatively you may try your luck with a GLM, it is not immediately clear what would be a random effect in this case though, maybe some not-shown-above variable such as where the message /news was posted. If all else fails a different model with less assumptions would probably work well too, especially if you have a pretty complex situation such as in your case. Regression random forests would be my first choice."}
